FAKE DATA LAYER IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
=======================================

Overview:
The Dashboard, Ventes (Sales), and Rapports (Reports) pages now use a unified fake data system stored in localStorage. All three pages are fully interconnected with realistic, dynamic data.

Key Improvements:
-----------------

1. CENTRALIZED FAKE DATA SERVICE (src/services/fakeData.js)
   - Products: 12 realistic products with images, categories, and pricing in XOF
   - Stock: Real-time stock tracking with min/max levels
   - Sales: 45 pre-generated historical transactions spanning 30 days
   - Network delay simulation (200-600ms) for realistic loading states
   - Automatic data initialization on first load
   - Last updated timestamp tracking

2. API INTEGRATION (src/services/api.js)
   - Detects if real API_URL is available, otherwise uses fake data
   - Seamless switching between fake and real backends
   - All endpoints now support the fake data layer:
     * productsApi.getProducts()
     * stockApi.getStock()
     * salesApi.getSales() / createSale()
     * dashboardApi.getSummary()
     * reportsDataApi.getSalesReport()

3. DASHBOARD PAGE ENHANCEMENTS
   - Dynamic stats cards showing:
     * Total revenue (last 30 days)
     * Average ticket price
     * Low stock count with out-of-stock alerts
     * Total stock value
   - Real-time sales chart (last 7 days)
   - Transaction volume chart
   - Last updated timestamp with relative time display
   - Smooth fade-in animations for visual polish
   - Loading states with spinner

4. VENTES (POS) PAGE IMPROVEMENTS
   - Connected to fake API for product data
   - Sales automatically saved to localStorage
   - Stock validation (prevents overselling)
   - Stock automatically decremented after each sale
   - Recent sales panel showing last 5 transactions:
     * Transaction ID
     * Total amount
     * Item count
     * Payment method
     * Time of sale
   - React Query cache invalidation to update all pages
   - Improved loading and error states
   - Consistent XOF currency formatting

5. RAPPORTS (REPORTS) PAGE UPGRADES
   - Three report types with filter dropdown:
     * Ventes (Sales)
     * Stocks (Stock levels)
     * Revenus (Revenue)
   - Period selection (7d, 30d, 90d)
   - Dynamic, data-driven charts:
     * Sales evolution line chart
     * Stock vs minimum comparison
     * Category distribution pie chart
     * Top 10 products by revenue
   - Smart CSV export system:
     * Exports data based on selected report type
     * Proper CSV formatting with quotes
     * Automatic filename generation
     * Success/error toasts
   - Enhanced loading states
   - Empty state handling

6. UI/UX POLISH
   - Fade-in animations for cards and sections
   - Hover states with elevation effects
   - Consistent loading spinners with messages
   - Proper empty state placeholders
   - Responsive design maintained
   - Consistent XOF currency formatting (no decimals)
   - Better visual hierarchy

7. DATA FLOW
   Sales Page → Add Sale → Updates:
   - localStorage sales array
   - localStorage stock levels
   - Dashboard stats (via React Query)
   - Recent sales list
   - Reports data
   
   All changes persist across page refreshes via localStorage.

Technical Details:
------------------
- Network latency: 200-600ms random delay
- Currency: CFA Franc (XOF) with proper formatting
- Tax rate: 20% VAT
- Stock tracking: Automatic deduction on sale
- Cache invalidation: Dashboard, products, stock, recent sales
- Data persistence: localStorage with automatic initialization

Files Modified:
---------------
- src/services/fakeData.js (NEW)
- src/services/api.js (UPDATED)
- src/pages/Dashboard.jsx (UPDATED)
- src/pages/Sales.jsx (UPDATED)
- src/pages/Reports.jsx (UPDATED)
- src/index.css (UPDATED - added animations)

The system now provides a fully functional demo that feels like a real ERP application with interconnected data, realistic delays, and professional UI polish.
